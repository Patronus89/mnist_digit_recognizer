📁 Dataset
The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). The dataset is automatically downloaded when running the training script.

🧱 Model Architecture
The CNN model comprises the following layers:

Convolutional Layer 1: 32 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation

Max Pooling Layer 1: 2x2 pool size

Convolutional Layer 2: 64 filters, 3x3 kernel, ReLU activation

Max Pooling Layer 2: 2x2 pool size

Flatten Layer

Fully Connected Layer: 128 neurons, ReLU activation

Output Layer: 10 neurons (for digits 0-9), softmax activation

Note: Adjust this section to match your actual model architecture.

📊 Results
The trained model achieves the following performance on the test set:

Accuracy: 98.5%

Loss: 0.05

Note: Update these metrics based on your actual results.
